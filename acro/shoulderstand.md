## Flyer

About forearm grips: there are 3 grips front (push), back (pull), side, we will analyze the front and back grips and their conseuences.

**Front Grip or Push Grip**: it allows the flyer to push find balance if falling towards his toes, base is responsible if flyer is falling backwards.

**Back Grip or Pull Grip**: it allows the flyer to pull themself if falling backwards, its useful in arched positions or controlled transitions in that direction.
